<h3 id="double-spending">Double Spending</h3>
<p>GHash has had a troubled history being a good mining citizen. In November of 2013, <a href="https://medium.com/@octskyward/double-spending-in-bitcoin-be0f1d1e8008#.2ctqvj69o">it was reported</a> that GHash was deliberately executing double spend attacks to defraud a gambling site called BetCoin Dice.</p>
<h3 id="excessive-share">Excessive Share</h3>
<p>In June of 2014, GHash controlled a very large share of the network&#39;s hashing power, sparking fears of a potential fifty-one percent attack. While a miner has only a marginal chance of succeeding at a double spend with a minority hashing power stake in the network, with a fifty-one percent share a miner can execute a double spend with one hundred percent certainty.</p>
<p>Confidence was shaken in the network, Core Developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/281ftd/why_i_just_sold_50_of_my_bitcoins_ghashio/">Peter Todd publicly announced</a> that the problem was so serious he was liquidating half of his Bitcoin savings. In response GHash deliberately backed off from their majority share, although it&#39;s impossible to know if they simply redirected their hashing power at other pools.</p>
<h2 id="slush-pool">Slush Pool</h2>
<p><strong>Slush Pool</strong>, also known as <strong>Bitcoin Pooled Mining</strong>, is a mining pool that was started November 27, 2010 and has been mining blocks since December 16, 2010. </p>
<p>On November 11, 2012 Slush&#39;s pool mined the two hundred and ten thousandth block, which is notable for being the first block of the first half point of the block subsidy. Instead of the original fifty coin reward, Slush&#39;s pool was rewarded twenty-five coins for the solution.</p>
<p>The mining pool uses a coinbase signature &quot;/slush/&quot;, and it follows a philosophy of being responsive to individual hashers preferences.</p>
