<p><strong>BitQuick</strong> (formerly BuyBitcoin) is an informal exchange that is focused on buyers who want to use cash deposits or SEPA transfers to acquire Bitcoins. </p>
<p>The BitQuick model is similar to Paxful or Localbitcoins, in that it provides a marketplace for buyers and sellers who want to make individual trades and not exchange on a more traditional market. However BitQuick stands in the middle of the trades to a higher degree, in order to streamline the experience and manage risk.</p>
<p>BitQuick operates in Australia, Canada, the EU, Russia, and the US.</p>

<p>LocalBitcoins offers an escrow service to protect Bitcoin buyers: LocalBitcoins locks the Bitcoin to trade in a custodial wallet to secure the successful trade and guarantee to the buyer that a seller is fully staking his trade and that an appeal may be made int he event of a dispute.</p>
