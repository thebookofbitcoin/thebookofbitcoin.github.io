<p><strong>Wei Dai</strong>, or <em>戴维</em>, is an open source software developer who is widely credited with some of the original ideas that led up to Bitcoin. Wei Dai published a digital monetary system proposal similar to the Bitcoin concept called <em>b-money</em>, and he published the well known C++ cryptographic library Crypto++.</p>
<p>Wei Dai holds a bachelors degree in Computer Science from University of Washington, and worked for Microsoft in Redmond Washington on cryptography research projects.</p>
<p>As part of his cryptographic research, Wei Dai has published major security vulnerabilities in SSH2 and against SSL/TLS, prompting quick fixes.</p>
<p>Wei Dai&#39;s 1998 concept for b-money proposed a system quite similar to the later Bitcoin scheme. Proof of work was used by a miner who updated a shared ledger of transactions secured through cryptographic signatures, much the same as in Satoshi Nakamoto&#39;s later system.</p>
<p>In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto privately contacted Adam Back with his draft proposal, before publishing it to the cryptography mailing list. Adam related in a <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=15672.msg1873483#msg1873483">forum post</a> that he pushed Satoshi to contact Wei Dai and credit <em>b-money</em> in the Bitcoin white paper. Wei Dai mentioned that the monetary concepts were similar and Satoshi determined he had realized an implementation of b-money, however Wei stated that the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/4cs/making_money_with_bitcoin/3lq1">ideas were originated in parallel</a>.</p>
