<p>Although Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the currency was originally not used for direct commerce due to its uncertain value and geographically distributed fan base. </p>
<p>On May 22nd 2010, two Bitcoin enthusiasts: Floridian Laszlo Hanyecz, also known as <em>laszlo</em>, a contributing developer to the Bitcoin source code, and UK resident Jeremy Sturdivant, also known as <em>jercos</em>, arranged a public transaction that is generally considered to be the first known commercial transaction on the Bitcoin Blockchain. Two pizzas originally purchased from Papa John&#39;s Pizza were <a href="https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/tx/a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d">exchanged for ten thousand bitcoins</a>.</p>
<p>On May 17th, Laszlo had posted a topic on the BitcoinTalk forum, outlining his desire to consume a pizza and his offer to trade a sum of Bitcoins for the privilege.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I&#39;m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don&#39;t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a &#39;breakfast platter&#39; at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you&#39;re happy! ... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some days after his initial request, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195#msg1195">Laszlo reported</a> that Jeremy had fulfilled his order, and he had sent Jeremy a sum of Bitcoin that while commensurate with the purchase at the time, would over the next few years rise to top ten million dollars in value.</p>
<p>This event was considered so noteworthy that many Bitcoin enthusiasts created an annual event around the May 22 date, to make a point of purchasing pizza for Bitcoin in remembrance of the first step into a Bitcoin world.</p>
