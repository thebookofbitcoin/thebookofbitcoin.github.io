# Jed McCaleb

The MTGox exchange, although generally thought of as an operation owned an operated by Mark Karpelès, was actually created by **Jed McCaleb**. Jed McCaleb had been involved with Bitcoin from an early time, and had previously contributed to decentralized networks with his file-sharing service EDonkey2000.

After selling 88% of MTGox to Mark Karpelès, in 2011 Jed went on to form a new digital currency solution called *Ripple*, which was a centralized financial solution designed to facilitate flows of capital between federated gatekeepers.

Due to disagreements at Ripple, Jed parted ways with Ripple in 2014 and began work on a new similar financial product, called *Stellar*, also designed as a centralized capital movement solution.
