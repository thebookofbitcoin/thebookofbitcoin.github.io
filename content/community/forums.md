## BitcoinTalk

**BitcoinTalk** is a forum for discussing Bitcoin that was originally founded by Satoshi Nakamoto in November of 2009, but later turned over to be operated by Martti Malmi and then Theymos.

The original forum used a SourceForge hosted service, it was later moved to be hosted by Martti Malmi on bitcoin.org, and all SourceForge forum content was lost. In July of 2011 the forum was separated from bitcoin.org and became a standalone site on bitcointalk.org.

The **/r/bitcoin** forum is a popular Bitcoin forum started in September of 2010 and hosted on the Reddit social media website.

The moderation team of the forum is led by Theymos, and enforces strict topical policies relating to off-topic discussion, based on the theory that the overall Reddit platform can deal with off-topic subject matter in other dedicated forums.
