# Bitcoin Information Portals

## bitcoin.org

The **bitcoin.org** website is the non-profit Bitcoin information project that was started by Satoshi Nakamoto in [August of 2008](http://whois.domaintools.com/bitcoin.org). Work on the project was quickly taken over by Martti Malmi, also known as Sirius.

The website has been used for a variety of purposes, such as hosting Bitcoin Core binaries, recommending Bitcoin wallets, as well as explaining the basic ideas behind Bitcoin.

## Bitcoin Wiki

The **Bitcoin Wiki** is a collaboratively edited encyclopedic reference on Bitcoin topics, that was started by Martii Malmi in April of 2010. The project was later taken over by Mark Karpelès.

### Contributions

Although the Bitcoin Wiki is conceptually a collaborative venture, the actual activity on the project has remained at low levels and the bar to collaborate has been raised to a high level to account for a lack of interest in managing the project and the pressure of peer editors to reduce the quality of the content by promoting their own interests.

Under Mark Karpelès's management, an effort to raise a bounty to offer to quality contributions was made, resulting in a collection of five hundred bitcoins, however [this bounty was never paid out](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin.it_Wiki_Contributors%27_Award) and is unaccounted for.
