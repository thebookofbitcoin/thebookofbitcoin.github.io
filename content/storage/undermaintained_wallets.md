# Under-maintained Wallets

## Armory

**Armory** is a cross-platform fully validating Bitcoin wallet, based on Bitcoin Core. Armory features an HD wallet and a wide variety of security and backup features. The project was first announced in [January of 2012](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=56424.0).

Armory has been going through a transition in development team, making the future of the project unclear.

## MultiBit

MultiBit is an open source light wallet that was [first published](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=43616.0 MultiBit) in September of 2011. MultiBit is MIT licensed and built on top of the bitcoinj library, versions are available for Linux, Windows and OSX.

MultiBit uses the lower-security SPV validation mode which gives a user lower security for receiving payments and lower privacy but removes the lengthy syncing time that a full node requires. MultiBit also includes support for multiple wallets and fiat value hinting.

MultiBit has two versions, an older and obsoleted version that was renamed *Classic*, and a newer version named *HD* that supports the modern BIP 32 HD wallet configuration. Support from the original developer team has also been dropped for the MultiBit HD version, however a new team run by the hardware wallet manufacturer KeepKey has stated their intention to take over the project.
