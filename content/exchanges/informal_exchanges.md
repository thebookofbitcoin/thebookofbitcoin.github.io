# Bitcoin Informal Exchanges

## BitQuick

**BitQuick** (formerly BuyBitcoin) is an informal exchange that is focused on buyers who want to use cash deposits or SEPA transfers to acquire Bitcoins. 

The BitQuick model is similar to Paxful or Localbitcoins, in that it provides a marketplace for buyers and sellers who want to make individual trades and not exchange on a more traditional market. However BitQuick stands in the middle of the trades to a higher degree, in order to streamline the experience and manage risk.

BitQuick operates in Australia, Canada, the EU, Russia, and the US.
